    Okrzeja is HTTP web server with embedded database and interactive web
    UI with builtin code editor, file manager and administration panel. It is
    intended to be used by educational facilities in order to make learning web
    technologies easier by giving students (or anyone interested) proper tool kit.
    In Okrzeja, every registered user has its own web space, in which they can
    create HTML, CSS and JS files and store them in nested directories. The files
    created are publicly available, so users can share their pages with friends, family,
    teachers, or anyone they want.

      simple, responsive web user interface and REST API, for interacting with
      service without need for using browser. long-season is fully fledged, you
      don't need to setup external database or download interpreter. With long-season
      I was able to explore more advances golang topics like: concurrency, embedding
      web static files into binary or cross compilation. long-season is also my first
      open-source project with external contributions from other people.
