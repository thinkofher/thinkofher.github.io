### Profile

Self-made wannabe hacker with engineering background. I am a graduate of the **AGH University of Science and Technology** in Cracow. I am mainly interested in web technologies and operating systems from the Linux family. I am an enthusiast and an advocate of [Free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) and [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) software. I'm highly enjoying using bleeding edge technologies, especially modern programming languages such as Go, Python or Rust. In my free time I try to develop my private projects (check [my Github profile](https://github.com/thinkofher)!) and broaden my knowledge of programming techniques.

### Quick facts
- Loves minimalist software.
- Spends most of the time in the terminal emulator.
- Devoted [vim user](https://github.com/thinkofher/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/nvim/clean.vim).
- Can't imagine what the world was like without containers.
- Thinkpads are the only laptops.
