### Profile

Self-made wannabe hacker with engineering background. I am a graduate of the
**AGH University of Science and Technology** in Cracow and *University of
Lodz*. I am mainly interested in web technologies and operating systems from
the Linux family. I am an enthusiast and an advocate of
[Free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) and [Open
Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) software. I'm
highly enjoying using bleeding edge technologies, especially modern programming
languages such as Go, Rust or Elixir. In my free time I try to develop my
private projects (check [my Github profile](https://github.com/thinkofher)!)
and broaden my knowledge of programming techniques.

### Quick facts

- Loves minimalist software.
- Spends most of the time in the terminal emulator.
- Devoted
  [vim user](https://github.com/thinkofher/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/nvim/init.lua).
- Can't imagine what the world was like without containers.
- Is obsessed with improving development tools.

### Experience

- Poznan, [OLX Group](https://www.olxgroup.com/)
  - 02.2022 - now, **Software Engineer**. Currently I'm working as a Golang
    Software Enginner at OLX Group. I'm extending functionalities of multiple
    OLX Real Estate SaaS services (for example: [Otodom](https://otodom.pl)),
    backed by microservice architecture and AWS serverless solutions.
- Warszawa, [Grupa Wirtualna Polska](https://holding.wp.pl/en)

    responsible for maintenance of [1login.wp.pl](https://1login.wp.pl/) and
    [poczta.wp.pl](https://profil.wp.pl/).

    During my time in WP I was able to interact with a lot of different industry
    standards for distributed systems, such as: mail protocols (IMAP, POP3) or
    authorization and authentication protocols (OAuth, OpenID, WebAuthn). I've
    done some R&D (mainly for WebAuthn) and systems design, especially for web
    JSON APIs. I learned a lot about NoSQL databases, their advantages and
    disadvantages in terms of use within the microservice architecture.
- Lodz, Fujitsu Technology Solutions
