#### Mail

I strongly recommend you to use e2e encryption, when using e-mail for personal conversations.

`mail at bdudek.xyz`, [gpg key](assets/gpg/mailatbdudek.xyz.public.asc)

#### [Telegram](https://t.me/thinkofher)

#### IRC

You can reach me at [libera.chat](https://libera.chat/). My nickname is `@thinkofher`.

#### [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@thinkofher:matrix.org)

Yeah matrix is cool, but it still lacks a good native client. Using web app for instant messaging is not exactly the type of user experience I am looking for. But you can still try to reach me using matrix protocol, just don't expect instant response from my side.
