### Mail

I strongly recommend you to use e2e encryption, when using e-mail for personal conversations.

`mail at bdudek.xyz`, [gpg key](assets/gpg/mailatbdudek.xyz.pub.asc)

### IRC

`IRC` protocol is my preferred way of doing instant messaging. I have bouncer setup so you
can assume I'll read your messages, even if I'm currently away from keyboard.

You can reach me at [libera.chat](https://libera.chat/). My nickname is `@thinkofher`.
I spend most of the time at `#hakierspejs` channel. You can join it [here](https://web.libera.chat/#hakierspejs).

### Telegram

Invite link for telegram is [here](https://t.me/thinkofher).

### Matrix

Invite link for matrix is [here](https://matrix.to/#/@thinkofher:matrix.org).

Yeah matrix is cool, but it still lacks a good native client. Using web app for instant messaging is not exactly the type of user experience I am looking for. But you can still try to reach me using matrix protocol, just don't expect instant response from my side.
