#### Mail

I strongly recommend you to use e2e encryption, when using e-mail for personal conversations. I am personally using Thunderbird as my daily driver e-mail client and it supports e2e [out of the box](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/openpgp-thunderbird-howto-and-faq).

- `beniamin.dudek at yahoo.com`, [gpg key](assets/gpg/yahoo.asc), please use this e-mail to contact me about **business** matters, for example: job offers. Sometimes, I also use this e-mail for mailing lists.
- `piaskpiasku at gmail.com`, [gpg key](assets/gpg/gmail.asc), please use this e-mail for personal conversations or if you want to talk with me about my projects.

#### [Telegram](https://t.me/thinkofher)

Although I have Telegram account, I strongly recommend you to use Matrix protocol for instant messaging. Matrix supports e2e and both client and server are free and open source software. In fact, there are [many matrix clients](https://matrix.org/clients/) out there!
