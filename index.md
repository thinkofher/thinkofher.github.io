I guess this is it. My personal space in the middle of world
wide web. I don't have any particular idea for this place.
I will probably upload some stuff, write about my projects and
try my hand in technical writing. I really enjoy reading about
people struggling with modern technologies during their work
on different projects. It's both entertaining and informative,
so I want to take a part in this trend. Also, expect some
[setters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setter) from time
to time.

My latest post on the blog: "[{{ site.posts[0].title }}]({{ site.posts[0].url }})".

If you came here in hope for some collaboration, you're more
than welcome. Check out [about](/about) page and visit my
[projects](/projects). This will give you a brief overview
of my competencies.

Check out my presence in social media by clicking one of the

I'm truly humbled you came to me, but right now it's time for
some dogo. Enjoy!
